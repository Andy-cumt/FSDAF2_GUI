# FSDAF2_GUI
The program of FSDAF 2.0.
This program according to the paper Guo D, Shi W, Hao M, et al. FSDAF 2.0: Improving the performance of retrieving land cover changes and preserving spatial details[J]. Remote Sensing of Environment, 2020,248:111973. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111973. 

The main idea is using change detection technology to find type changes areas then make targeted optimization.

The authors greatly thank the great work of FSDAF, SFSDAF from Xiaolin Zhu, Eileen H. Helmer, Feng Gao, Desheng Liu, Jin Chen, Michael A. Lefsky, Xiaodong Li, Giles M. Foody, Doreen S. Boyd, Yong Ge, Yihang Zhang, Yun Du, Feng Ling.
